# Rocks, Minerals, & Gemstones

As a geology enthusiast, I find it fascinating how some basic molecular forms can create such a large variety of structures as a result of the variables involved in its creation. 

Rocks, minerals, & gemstones basically rock because they come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colours and can be used for both practical and aesthetic purposes. 

## Purpose

I hope to learn about what it takes to make design systems for large-scale websites. 

I also hope to create an engaging, organized, and educational resource for people looking for more information on rocks, minerals, and gemstones.
